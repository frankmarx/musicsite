						Very often<br>
						I’ve been just too close for comfort<br>
						With the boss man<br>
						I feel lost and<br>
						I’m just way too close for comfort<br>
						With the boss Man<br>
						Very often<br>
						<br>
						All these days<br>
						All these worries<br>
						Am I ever gonna change?<br>
						Or stay the same<br>
						So I cave<br>
						Let my world go<br>
						Treating life like it’s a game<br>
						And just stay away<br>      
						From myself<br>
						I can’t tell<br>
						All I know’s<br>
						All is well<br>
						From this state<br>
						I create<br>
						Makes me sane<br>
						Is it fake?<br>
						Its too late<br>
						I’m too close<br>
						And I know<br>
						My mistake<br>
						But it comes<br>
						Never goes<br>
						Feels like the<br>
						Only way<br>
						To escape<br>
						<br>
						All these days in the world<br>
						I just go with the closer<br>
						Let it take over<br>
						It’s all in my head<br>
						<br>
						Very often<br>
						I’ve been just too close for comfort<br>
						With the boss man<br>
						I feel lost and<br>
						I’m just way too close for comfort<br>
						With the boss Man<br>
						Very often<br>
						<br>
						He only ever won<br>
						He only ever won<br>
						He only ever won<br>
						He only ever won<br>
						<br>
						All these days in the world<br>
						I just go with the closer<br>
						Let it take over<br>
						It’s all in my head<br>
						<br>
						Very often<br>
						I’ve been just too close for comfort<br>
						With the boss man<br>
						I feel lost and<br>
						I’m just way too close for comfort<br>
						With the boss Man<br>
						Very often<br>
						<br>
						Very often<br>
						I’ve been just too close for comfort<br>
						With the boss man<br>
						I feel lost and<br>
						I’m just way too close for comfort<br>
						With the boss Man<br>
						Very often

						You didn’t have to leave alone<br>
						You could’ve said good bye<br>
						You didn’t have to leave alone<br>
						You could’ve said good bye<br>

						Guess I didn’t even notice<br>

						I'm dancing alone<br>
						I'm fly as I go<br>
						I'm breathing it in<br>
						Like it's always been<br>
						Now I'm dancing<br>
						Dancing alone<br>
						Just give me one more minute<br>
						I'm not ready<br>
						I've been waiting<br>
						And I can't let it go<br>
						<br>
						Thought I was doing so well<br>
						But now I can’t even tell<br>
						I thought that we were doing well<br>
						I thought that we were doing well<br>

						You didn’t have to leave alone<br>
						You could’ve said good bye<br>
						You didn’t have to leave alone<br>
						You could’ve said good bye<br>

						I never thought I'd be here<br>
						Unless it's only me here<br>
						I never thought I'd be here<br>
						I never thought I'd be here<br>

						And I've seen that place before<br>

						Just take a second<br>
						To recognize the present<br>
						Isn't this this this future<br>
						You were oh so scared of?<br>
						I start the record<br>
						And let go of the pressure<br>
						Forget about the worries<br>
						Of the days so far away<br>
						I get this feeling<br>
						Like there could be some meaning<br>
						I'm trying to believe it<br>
						I'll just wait and see<br>
						<br>
						If it's another illusion<br>
						I know just what to do<br>
						And I'll be alright<br>
						<br>
						I'm stuck, waiting for the day<br>
						I've been feelin like the time won't come<br>
						It's like I make every possible mistake<br>
						When I'm thinking ahead<br>
						<br>
						If things were different<br>
						If only I had listened<br>
						maybe I'd be flying high away from all this<br>
						Anticipation<br>
						I'd make the realization<br>
						There's another day gone by<br>
						While I'm just left behind<br>
						And I've been thinking<br>
						That this time could be different<br>
						Is this what they call living?<br>
						I'll just wait and see<br>
						<br>
						If it's another illusion<br>
						I know just what to do<br>
						And I'll be alright<br>
						<br>
						It's up and down<br>
						The world keeps spinning round<br>
						It's up and down<br>
						The world keeps spinning round<br>
						It's up and down<br>
						The world keeps spinning round<br>
						<br>
						I'm stuck, waiting for the day<br>
						I've been feeling like the time won't come<br>
						It's like I'll make every possible mistake<br>
						When I'm thinking ahead<br>
						<br>
						I'm stuck, waiting for the day<br>
						I've been feeling like the time won't come<br>
						It's like I'll make every possible mistake<br>
						When I'm thinking ahead
