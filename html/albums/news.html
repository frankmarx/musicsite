						No sleep and I’m wide awake<br>
						Dreaming 'bout some better days<br>
						Oh we gon make everything ok<br>
						<br>
						This isn’t the last time<br>
						Im guessing I’ll feel this way again<br>
						When did days become a wasted repeat?<br> 
						Never will it end<br>
						I just wanna hear you<br>
						Tell me things are all alright<br>
						Maybe years from now those words no longer<br>
						Echo in my mind<br>
						<br>
						No sleep, and I’m wide awake<br>
						Dreaming 'bout some better days<br>
						Oh we gon make everything ok<br>
						<br>
						No sleep, and I’m wide awake<br>
						Dreaming 'bout some better days<br>
						Oh can we make everything ok<br>
						<br>
						I’m thinking I met you<br>
						Havent I seen your face before?<br>
						Why don’t we pretend<br>
						That something really matters in this world?<br>
						Im thinking of crying<br>
						Cause I don’t know what to say<br>
						But you get it all out of me<br>
						Away from things that make me different<br>
						<br>
						No sleep, and I’m wide awake<br>
						Dreaming 'bout some better days<br>
						Oh can we make everything ok<br>
						<br>					
						Was starting to like you<br>
						I’m starting to miss you by my side<br>
						Why’d it have to end<br>
						This way?

						I’m throwing away<br>
						A night with you girl<br>
						Im starting to think about myself<br>
						Ive waited too long<br>
						Left up to you<br>
						If only I known what you knew<br>
						There are just things<br>
						That I cant see through<br>
						Never will know<br>
						<br>
						Never will know<br>
						What you’ve been thinking<br>
						Im Stuck on my own<br>
						I'm just here wishing<br>
						For a sign to show<br>
						What this is different<br>
						Never will know<br>
						How you feel<br>
						<br>
						I want to feel something new<br>
						Cause everyday is just the same<br>
						With you girl<br>
						Does it really even matter<br>
						If I'm staying or I'm leaving<br>
						<br>
						Never will know<br>
						What you’ve been thinking<br>
						Im Stuck on my own<br>

						The sky is falling<br>
						Turn the speakers up<br>
						Lets get lost<br>
						Small town<br>
						But your eyes can do the job<br>
						But you’re pulling away<br>
						Like you don’t know me<br>
						And worst of it all<br>
						Is the way that you seem<br>
						Fine without me<br>
						We’re floating away<br>
						But you don’t notice<br>
						Making it seem like nothing really matters<br>
						Baby<br>
						<br>
						So if its going under<br>
						And were just going in further<br>
						Then babe I don’t wanna wonder<br>
						I think I know that its over<br>
						But I wanna be there with you<br>
						Yea I wanna be there<br>
						Wanna be there with you<br>
						<br>
						Be there with you<br>
						Be there with you<br>
						Be there with you<br>
						Be there with you<br>
						Be there with you<br>
						Be there with you<br>
						<br>
						The weather is changing<br>
						Days are getting shorter<br>
						So lets run away<br>
						Where nothing really matters<br>
						Baby<br>
						<br>
						And days go by and I don’t mind<br>
						I smile and wave goodbye<br>
						And then days go by<br>
						where all I want to do is run and hide<br>
						<br>
						Be there with you<br>
						Be there with you<br>
						Be there with you<br>
						Be there with you<br>
						Be there with you<br>
						Be there with you<br>
						<br>
						So if its going under<br>
						and were just going in further<br>
						Then babe I don’t wanna wonder<br>
						I think I know that its over<br>
						But I wanna be there with you<br>
						Yea I wanna be there<br>
						Wanna be there with you<br>
