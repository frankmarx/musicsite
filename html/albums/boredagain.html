						Just found out<br>
						That love's not real<br>
						When you're afraid to feel<br>
						It's scary, I know<br>
						<br>
						And I could tell by the way you left<br>
						You walked away, but you turned your head<br>
						To look at me<br>
						What did you see?<br>
						Sometimes I can't be held<br>
						I fly like a bird away<br>
						But when I love, I do it well<br>
						Is that enough to make you stay?<br>
						<br>
						Just found out<br>
						That love's not real<br>
						When you're afraid to feel<br>
						It's scary, I know

						Yeah I know I<br>
						Already had my chance before<br>
						So do you know why<br>
						I kinda want you even more?<br>
						It's like every time I close my eyes<br>
						I gotta watch you cross my mind<br>
						<br>
						I don't wanna be bored again<br>
						Wanna be be bored again<br>
						Be bored again<br>
						Again again<br>
						Wanna I don't wanna<br>
						I don't wanna be bored again<br>

						Nobody warns you<br>
						What you'll turn to when you're bored<br>
						If somebody told you<br>
						It's like waiting around for mistakes<br>
						Would you listen to what they were saying<br>
						Or would you do what's easy for you?<br>

						I know it's Sunday morning<br>
						Cause I'm sitting and I'm wishing<br>
						I was stoned with you<br>
						If I was offered every single<br>
						Moment in the world<br>
						I'd just take one with you<br>
						<br>
						I say there's nothing left<br>
						But if I heard you call for me<br>
						Then I'd be back for you<br>

						For anything but something new<br>

						I thought that I got good information<br>
						I got it from a guy who thought everything's wrong<br>
						So I knew he was right<br>
						<br>
						I can feel it<br>
						It's not too hard<br>
						He's bringing me down<br>
						<br>
						I thought that I got good information<br>
						It came from the heart<br>
						But then I felt the beat from another one<br>
						It got me to stop<br>
						<br>
						I can feel it<br>
						It's not too hard<br>
						He's bringing you down<br>
						Can you hear it?<br>
						It's not too hard<br>
						It's kinda loud<br>
						<br>
						I thought that I got good information<br>
						It came from the heart<br>
						But then I felt the beat from another one<br>
						It got me to stop<br>
						<br>
						I really don't wanna settle<br>
						Maybe it's time to let go<br>
						And let my worries down
