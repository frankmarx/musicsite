						What if this is real?<br>
						In the morning you reveal<br>
						All that you've concealed<br>
						Or we could make a deal<br>
						I'll give everything<br>
						For anything to feel<br>
						And what if we were there?<br>
						What if we could care?<br>
						What if there was sorrow?<br>
						But all that's left for you<br>
						Is holding on<br>
						To what you think is true<br>
						<br>
						So go ahead and speak<br>
						And cover up their grief<br>
						Like moonlight on the water<br>
						Void of any grace<br>
						You find a way<br>
						To justify your place<br>
						And smother us in pride<br>
						Pretend to take our side<br>
						You couldn't if you tried<br>
						And all that's left for you<br>
						Is hoping that<br>
						The gates will let you through

						I feel lost and<br>

						I can't tell<br>
						All I know is<br>
						All is well<br>

						Makes me sane<br>
						Is it fake?<br>
						It's too late<br>
						I'm too close<br>
						And I know<br>
						My mistake<br>
						But it comes<br>
						Never goes<br>
						Feels like the<br>
						Only way<br>
						To escape<br>
						<br>
						All these days in the world I just go with the closer<br>
						Let it take over<br>
						It's all in my head<br>
						<br>
						Very often<br>
						I've been just too close for comfort with the Boss Man<br>
						I feel lost and<br>
						I'm just way too close for comfort with the Boss Man<br>
						Very often<br>
						<br>
						He only ever won<br>
						He only ever won<br>
						He only ever won<br>
						He only ever won<br>
						<br>
						All these days in the world I just go with the closer<br>
						Let it take over<br>
						It's all in my head<br>

						Very often<br>
						I've been just too close for comfort with the Boss Man<br>
