						What if we’re in heaven?<br>
						What if heaven's real?<br>
						It's everyone we love<br>
						Everything we touch<br>
						And everything we feel<br>
						Don’t want to spend my life waiting<br>
						For a kingdom that’s to come<br>
						Dreams of fame and fortune<br>
						Some paradise in the sun<br>
						<br>
						You can be<br>
						You can be<br>
						Happy<br>
						<br>
						As I’m walking through heaven<br>
						I see angels everywhere<br>
						They’re flying and gliding<br>
						And thinking all those angel thoughts<br>
						Instead of being here<br>
						When I get so tired<br>
						I need lay down in my bed<br>
						I hope I wake up in the morning<br>
						Heaven's wasted on the dead<br>
						<br>
						You can be<br>
						You can be<br>
						Happy<br>
						<br>
						Thoughts of wisdom<br>
						Thoughts of strife<br>
						Thoughts that keep me<br>
						Up all night<br>
						Thoughts that are sometimes hard<br>
						To recall<br>
						Thoughts that spill out<br>
						Like a waterfall<br>
						Like a waterfall<br>
						<br>
						Now that we’re in heaven<br>
						Since we’re already dead<br>
						Can we love just to love<br>
						And rise above<br>
						And get out of our heads<br>
						Let’s soak up all this beauty<br>
						Start living for today<br>
						Stop living for the dying<br>
						Hoping heavens on the way 
						Hey hey hey<br>
						<br>
						You can be<br>
						You can be<br>
						Happy

						It’s been a long day<br>
						He leaves her appartment in the usual way<br>
						Tells himself it's over<br>
						Just like he’s done a thousand times before<br>
						<br>
						And he wonders if he’s doing any good in this world<br>
						Hey everyone’s got it tough<br>
						Figures he’s doing enough<br>
						He’s doing enough<br>
						<br>
						He's on his way home<br>
						Traffic sucks but he’s finally on his own<br>
						He knows he’s here to stay<br>
						Wonders how it ever got this way<br>
						<br>
						And he spent so many years feeling sorry for himself<br>
						Oh his life is so tough<br>
						He’s not sorry enough<br>
						He’s not sorry enough<br>
						<br>
						He lays in his bed<br>
						All this shit spinning round in his head<br>
						She lays by his side<br>
						He turns away keeps it all bottled up inside<br>
						<br>
						She asks him if he’s happy after all these years<br>
						Was your day that rough?<br>
						Darlin I’m happy enough<br>
						I’m happy enough<br>
						<br>
						You talk about love<br> 
						And I talk about pain<br>
						You just keep talking<br>
						But I can’t hear a word that you say anymore<br>
						<br>
						They make love at midnight<br>
						She reaches over she squeezes him so damn tight<br>
						And she can’t let go<br>
						No she can’t let go<br>
						<br>
						And he thinks to himself<br>
						As he drifts off to sleep<br>	
						Forget all that other stuff<br>
						This One Love<br>
						This One Love<br>
						This One Love<br>
						This One Love<br>
						This One Love<br>
						It’s enough

						I knew I took it a little too far<br>
						When I met you in that hot, smokey bar<br>
						You slapped my face and ran out to your car<br>
						<br>
						Now I still don't know<br>
						Still don’t know<br>
						Where you are<br>
						<br>
						I won’t take standing up looking like a fool<br>
						So I’ll just sit my ass on this bar stool<br>
						That slap it hurt, but it won’t leave a scar<br>
						<br>
						And I still don’t know<br>
						Still don’t know<br>
						Where you are<br>
						<br>
						I let your phone ring 37 times<br>
						I need to get you off my worried mind<br>
						Now there’s a sweet thing at the end of the bar<br>
						And I still don’t know<br>
						Still don’t know<br>
						Where you are<br>
						<br>
						We’re leaving now, that sweet thing and me<br>
						Haven’t thought of you since 11:43<br>
						I’m in her arms when I look up to see your car<br>
						<br>
						It's coming right at me<br>
						I know exactly<br>
						Where you are<br>
						<br>
						Thought I got away<br>
						I'm falling<br>
						These scars upon my face<br>
						Let me know<br>
						I'm all that's<br>
						Up inside your brain<br>
						Let it be<br>
						'Cause I Know<br>
						I'm alright<br>
						Let it go<br>
						<br>
						I got tire tracks all along my back<br>
						My legs are broke but my head's intact<br>
						Is that you lord I see passing judgement from afar<br>
						<br>
						I still don’t know lord<br>
						I still don’t know<br>
						Where you are

						Meet me in my slumber<br>
						Meet me in my dreams<br>
						Meet me in the foothills<br>
						By a cool mountain stream<br>
						We’ll snuggle by the fire<br>
						On a cold winter’s night<br>
						Stroll through the city<br>
						The streets all filled with light<br>
						<br>
						Won't you meet me in the middle<br>
						I’ll move a little bit to you<br>
						Won't you meet me in the middle<br>
						You move a little my way too<br>
						<br>
						Meet me by the seashore<br>
						We'll make castles in the sand<br>
						Come up to the bonus room<br>
						You can all join the band<br>
						Won’t you meet me in the garden?<br>
						The fields all wet with rain<br>
						Hug me and squeeze me<br>
						Or I may go insane<br>
						<br>
						Won't you meet me in the middle<br>
						I’ll move a little bit to you<br>
						Won't you meet me in the middle<br>
						You move a little my way too<br>
						<br>
						Meet me in the meadow<br>
						Dance among the flowers<br>
						Should it start to rain<br>
						We’ll just run through the showers<br>
						Meet me for a margarita<br>
						In the late afternoon<br>
						Or a walk at midnight<br>
						In the light of the moon<br>
						<br>
						Won't you meet me in the middle<br>
						I’ll move a little bit to you<br>
						Won't you meet me in the middle<br>
						You move a little my way too

						Leave your ego by the door<br>
						You won’t need it anymore<br>
						It’s absurd for you to think<br>
						That you matter much at all<br>
						With my back against the wall<br>
						In the predawn light<br>
						The fog lifts, my mind drifts<br>
						And I think of that night<br>
						<br>
						Now it's time to worry baby<br>
						With your mono polar mind<br>
						Pegged to the bottom line<br>
						And we all live under the gun<br>
						My god what have we done<br>
						<br>
						When it’s lost you spend your time<br>
						Trying to keep it off your mind<br>
						You just end up losing more<br>
						All the things that you adore<br>
						<br>
						Forget everything that you’re hearing<br>
						About the glory of the fight<br>
						Sometimes you only need to stop the bleeding<br>
						To get it right<br>
						<br>
						There’s no going back<br>
						<br>
						Once the innocence is lost<br>
						The innocence is lost<br>
						<br>
						Now it's time to worry baby<br>
						With your mono polar mind<br>
						Pegged to that bottom line<br>
						And we all live under the gun<br>
						My god what have we done

						She looks out the window<br>
						And out through the snow<br>
						To the haloed street lights<br>
						In the lane below<br>
						And says to herself<br>
						There’s so much<br> 
						That I’ll never know<br>
						She says Hey!<br> 
						Let’s go down,<br>
						Let’s go down now<br>
						Through the snow<br>
						Let’s go down and dance<br>
						And sing<br>
						Down in the lane below<br>
						<br>
						I just want to waste<br>
						I just want to waste<br>
						I want to waste my time<br>
						With you<br>

						I want to climb that hillside again<br>
						With you<br>
						I want to walk in the garden<br>
						All misty wet with rain<br>
						So when the morning sun comes up<br>
						Let me drink from your lovin’ cup<br>
						And I’ll be drunk<br>
						I'll be drunk<br>
						I'll be drunk<br>
						The whole day through<br>
						<br>
						I just want to waste<br>
						I just want to waste<br>
						I want to waste my time<br>
						With you<br>
						<br>
						Before it’s the last time<br>
						Before the pain<br>
						Before we fade away<br>
						Like tear drop in the rain<br>
						Before my time is through<br>
						I just want to waste my time<br>
						With you<br>
						<br>
						Found a little piece of heaven<br>
						Right here on earth<br>
						A place of hope and understanding<br>
						I’m old enough to know<br>
						What that’s worth<br>
						Let’s walk down, hand-in-hand<br>
						To the stream<br>
						Rest a while<br>
						Beneath a moonbeam<br>
						As the fairy boats glide by<br>
						And bid ado<br>
						To me and you<br>
						You’re my favorite waste of time<br>
						Just a way 
						To ease my mind<br>
						You’re my favorite, favorite, favorite<br>
						Waste of time
