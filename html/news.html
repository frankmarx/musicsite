	No sleep and I’m wide awake<br>
	Dreaming 'bout some better days<br>
	Oh we gon make everything ok<br>
	<br>
	This isn’t the last time<br>
	Im guessing I’ll feel this way again<br>
	When did days become a wasted repeat?<br> 
	Never will it end<br>
	I just wanna hear you<br>
	Tell me things are all alright<br>
	Maybe years from now those words no longer<br>
	Echo in my mind<br>
	<br>
	No sleep, and I’m wide awake<br>

	Dreaming 'bout some better days<br>
	Oh can we make everything ok<br>
	<br>
	I’m thinking I met you<br>
	Havent I seen your face before?<br>
	Why don’t we pretend<br>
	That something really matters in this world?<br>
	Im thinking of crying<br>
	Cause I don’t know what to say<br>
	But you get it all out of me<br>
	Away from things that make me different<br>
	<br>
