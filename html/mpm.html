What if we’re in heaven?<br>
What if heaven's real?<br>
It's everyone we love<br>
Everything we touch<br>
And everything we feel<br>
Don’t want to spend my life waiting<br>
For a kingdom that’s to come<br>
Dreams of fame and fortune<br>
Some paradise in the sun<br>
<br>
You can be<br>
You can be<br>
Happy<br>
<br>
As I’m walking through heaven<br>
I see angels everywhere<br>
They’re flying and gliding<br>
And thinking all those angel thoughts<br>
Instead of being here<br>
When I get so tired<br>
I need lay down in my bed<br>
I hope I wake up in the morning<br>
Heaven's wasted on the dead
<br>
You can be<br>
You can be<br>
Happy<br>
<br>
Thoughts of wisdom, thoughts of strife<br>
Thoughts that keep me up all night<br>
Thoughts that are sometimes hard to recall<br>
Thoughts that spill out like a waterfall<br>
Like a waterfall<br>
<br>
Now that we’re in heaven<br>
Since we’re already dead<br>
Can we love just to love<br>
And rise above<br>
And get out of our heads<br>
Let’s soak up all this beauty<br>
Start living for today<br>
Stop living for the dying<br>
Hoping heavens on the way hey hey hey<br>
<br>
You can be<br>
You can be<br>
Happy<br>

It’s been a long day<br>
He leaves her appartment in the usual way<br>
Tells himself it's over<br>
Just like he’s done a thousand times before<br>
<br>
And he wonders if he’s doing any good in this world<br>
Hey everyone’s got it tough<br>
Figures he’s doing enough<br>
He’s doing enough<br>
<br>
He's on his way home<br>
Traffic sucks but he’s finally on his own<br>
He knows he’s here to stay<br>
Wonders how it ever got this way<br>
<br>
And he spent so many years feeling sorry for himself<br>
Oh his life is so tough<br>
He’s not sorry enough<br>
He’s not sorry enough<br>
<br>
He lays in his bed<br>
All this shit spinning round in his head<br>
She lays by his side<br>
He turns away keeps it all bottled up inside<br>
<br>
She asks him if he’s happy after all these years<br>
Was your day that rough?<br>
Darlin I’m happy enough<br>
I’m happy enough<br>
<br>
You talk about love<br> 
And I talk about pain<br>
You just keep talking<br>
But I can’t hear a word that you say anymore<br>
<br>
They make love at midnight<br>
She reaches over she squeezes him so damn tight<br>
And she can’t let go<br>
No she can’t let go<br>
<br>
And he thinks to himself<br>
As he drifts off to sleep<br>	
Forget all that other stuff<br>
This One Love<br>
This One Love<br>
This One Love<br>
This One Love<br>
This One Love<br>
It’s enough

I knew I took it a little too far<br>
When I met you in that hot, smokey bar<br>
You slapped my face and ran out to your car<br>
<br>
Now I still don't know<br>
Still don’t know<br>
Where you are<br>
<br>
I won’t take standing up looking like a fool<br>
So I’ll just sit my ass on this bar stool<br>
That slap it hurt, but it won’t leave a scar<br>
<br>
And I still don’t know<br>
Still don’t know<br>
Where you are<br>
<br>
I let your phone ring 37 times<br>
I need to get you off my worried mind<br>
Now there’s a sweet thing at the end of the bar<br>
And I still don’t know<br>
Still don’t know<br>
Where you are<br>
<br>
We’re leaving now, that sweet thing and me<br>
Haven’t thought of you since 11:43<br>
I’m in her arms when I look up to see your car<br>
<br>
It's coming right at me<br>
I know exactly<br>
Where you are<br>
<br>
Thought I got away<br>
I'm falling<br>
These scars upon my face<br>
Let me know<br>
I'm all that's<br>
Up inside your brain<br>
Let it be<br>
'Cause I Know<br>
I'm alright<br>
Let it go<br>
<br>
I got tire tracks all along my back<br>
My legs are broke but my head's intact<br>
Is that you lord I see passing judgement from afar<br>
<br>
I still don’t know lord<br>
I still don’t know<br>
Where you are

Meet me in my slumber<br>
Meet me in my dreams<br>
Meet me in the foothills<br>
By a cool mountain stream<br>
We’ll snuggle by the fire<br>
On a cold winter’s night<br>
Stroll through the city<br>
The streets all filled with light<br>
<br>
Won't you meet me in the middle<br>
I’ll move a little bit to you<br>
Won't you meet me in the middle<br>
You move a little my way too<br>
<br>
Meet me by the seashore<br>
We'll make castles in the sand<br>
Come up to the bonus room<br>
You can all join the band<br>
Won’t you meet me in the garden?<br>
The fields all wet with rain<br>
Hug me and squeeze me<br>
Or I may go insane<br>
<br>
Won't you meet me in the middle<br>
I’ll move a little bit to you<br>
Won't you meet me in the middle<br>
You move a little my way too<br>
<br>
Meet me in the meadow<br>
Dance among the flowers<br>
Should it start to rain<br>
We’ll just run through the showers<br>
Meet me for a margarita<br>
In the late afternoon<br>
Or a walk at midnight<br>
In the light of the moon<br>
<br>
Won't you meet me in the middle<br>
I’ll move a little bit to you<br>
Won't you meet me in the middle<br>
You move a little my way too<br>

Leave your ego by the door<br>
You won’t need it anymore<br>
It’s absurd for you to think<br>
That you matter much at all<br>
With my back against the wall<br>
In the predawn light<br>
The fog lifts, my mind drifts<br>
And I think of that night<br>
<br>
Now it's time to worry baby<br>
With your mono polar mind<br>
Pegged to the bottom line<br>
And we all live under the gun<br>
My god what have we done<br>
<br>
When it’s lost you spend your time<br>
Trying to keep it off your mind<br>
You just end up losing more<br>
All the things that you adore<br>
<br>
Forget everything that you’re hearing<br>
About the glory of the fight<br>
Sometimes you only need to stop the bleeding<br>
To get it right<br>
<br>
There’s no going back<br>
<br>
Once the innocence is lost<br>
The innocence is lost<br>
<br>
Now it's time to worry baby<br>
With your mono polar mind<br>
Pegged to that bottom line<br>
And we all live under the gun<br>
My god what have we done<br>

The news of the world<br>
Is getting me down<br>
And it’s not gonna stop<br>
And when I think of our lives<br>
And the time we got<br>
I come to realize<br>
Yeah I realize<br>
That it’s not a lot<br>
So when I grow up<br>
I’m gonna be everything they’re not<br>
<br>
Stay with me tonight<br>
Come lay beside me<br>
And as the years slip by<br>
We’ll stay together<br>
Forever<br>
Together<br>
Forever<br>

She looks out the window through the snow
To the haloed street lights in the lane below
And to herself “There’s so much I’ll never know”
She says “Hey! Let’s go down,
Let’s go down through the snow
Let’s go down and sing and dance 
Down in the lane below”

I just want to waste 
I just want to waste 
I want to waste my time with you

I want to climb that hillside again with you
I want to walk in the garden misty wet with rain
So when the morning sun comes up
Let me drink from your lovin’ cup
And I’ll be drunk the whole day through

I just want to waste 
I just want to waste 
I want to waste my time with you

Before it’s the last time
Before all the pain
Before we fade away
Like tear drop in the rain
Before my time is through
I just want to waste my time with you

Found a little piece of heaven
Right here on earth
A place of hope and understanding
I’m old enough to know what that’s worth
Let’s walk down, hand-in-hand to the stream
Rest while beneath a moonbeam
As the fairy boats glide by and bid ado
To me and you
You’re my favorite waste of time……
A way to ease my mind
You’re my favorite, favorite, favorite waste of time

	When did days become a Wasted repeat<br>
